This Angel Nugget was recreated using the use of jQuery plugins to provide a more customizable plugin. 


Install:
	1. Download via zip or git to a folder e.g.: SystemCheck2
	
	2. Make sure that the stucture is:
		Example:  SystemCheck2/
			  SystemCheck2/files.....
	
	3. Upload this zip to your Angel Root\Portal\Nuggets and extract its contents.
		Example:  Angel Root\Portal\Nuggets\SystemCheck2 (after extracting and deleteing zip)
	
	4. Register the Nugget from within the  Portal Components Manager
	
	5. Add the Component to the Login Page for your Angel LMS
		Example: home.asp
	
	6. Make sure this install is set across all instance nodes


Notes:
This has been tested on a Windows PC across all broswers : Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox, Windows Sarfari.



The plugin uses window.navigator to obtain most of the browser information. It does have a dependency: jquery-migrate.
This plugin double checks the broswer app name and get a clean way of the browsers version. 


This plugin also uses a different method in checking for the plugins and displaying to the user. It no longer relies on Acrobat 
as being the only PDF Viewer. Chrome and believed Safari (haven't checked it yet, waiting for my Mac to be setup), have a pre-built
plugin call PDF Viewer. Since some users are unaware of this they do not know that they do not have to install Adobe Acrobat. For Mac
users, this plugin is checking for Flip4Mac as there do not have the correct plugin install to trigger the ok for Window Media Player.
This will allow the user to know what plugin they have installed.

	Example:
		Firefox: No native PDF viewer, install Acrobat and get a green check.

		Chrome: Native, Chrome PDF Viewer, the systme check prints out: Chrome PDF Viewer with a green check.


TODO:
More to come.....
