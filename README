		Example:  SystemCheck2/
			  SystemCheck2/files.....

		Example:  Angel Root\Portal\Nuggets\SystemCheck2 (after extracting and deleteing zip)

	5. Add the Component to the Login Page for your Angel LMS

Notes:
This has been tested on a Windows PC across all broswers : Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox, Windows Sarfari.



The plugin uses window.navigator to obtain most of the browser information. It does have a dependency: jquery-migrate.
This plugin double checks the broswer app name and get a clean way of the browsers version.
